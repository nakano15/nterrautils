Added a vertical offset position changer for the side bar elements.
Added InterfaceHelper class.
Made the mod no longer extract its source and resources.
 => Beside, there is the Github page to get the source from, so doesn't make sense this.
Moved WordWrap method from MainMod to InterfaceHelper.
Fixed a crash this mod would cause on npcs dialogues, when there was a quest available.
Made the Quest interface go back to first page when changing quests.
Added a Mouse Over Tooltip helper.
Added a method to InterfaceHelper which helps turning words into plural based on a count.
Added a method to InterfaceHelper which helps getting bidimensional direction text (like if position two is to the right of position 1, will tell that target is east).
