This mod is a utility mod (or library mod if you preffer) which adds some extra functions that 
other mods might make use of.

By itself, this mod doesn't do much.

Some of the functions this mod offers is adding tabs to the bottom part of the screen when the 
inventory is opened (which other mods can also use to add more tabs for their mods functions),
and a quest system.

You can find the discord of the mod bellow if you have questions:

You can use tModLoader to extract the mod dll to use it for script references (on the mods list, 
click the question mark, then ask it to extract).
